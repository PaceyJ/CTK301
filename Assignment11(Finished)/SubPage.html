            <h2>About Video</h2>
            <p>So the video under this text is a video that me and my friends made a few months ago. Pretty fun time, especially when I'm with my friends just doing something small like recording something and editing it together. Just a side note that the language in the video isn't really school appropriate. So a warning is advised beforehand.</p>

            <video width="320" height="180" autoplay controls loop preload="auto" >
                <source src="Skullgirls reactions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
              </video>

            <p>That video there was just me and some of my friends reacting to a game called Skullgirls and its a fighting game that I haven't heard of until that night. It was confusing at first but me and my friends started to understand it a lot more as we went on watching more clips and stuff. Also, this gif next to the text is very comforting and nice. Usually how I would like to spend my days.</p>
