                <p>A little bit more about me is that I also like to stream on Twitch from time to time! It's more a hobby than an actual profession but its fun for me and my friends. <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/chillboyprod">*Click here to go straight to my page*.</a> There are other streaming sites like <a href="Youtube.com">Youtube,</a> Kick, etc. But I main prefer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/">Twitch</a> for streaming and watching streams.</p>

                <p>For social media, I use a little bit. I mainly go on Instagram because that's where most of my friends are at in the first place. Other than that, there's SnapChat, TikTok, X/Twitter, and to actually talk to my firends, I'm on discord. Discord really is a good place to communicate with your friends or to make new friends by joining communities and safe places to talk about games, political topics, music, etc. <a href="https://discord.com/">*Here is a link to find Discord*.</a> What's also cool about it is that some of my classes are in discord so I can talk to some of my professors and peers with the app. It's been really helpful for me.</p>
