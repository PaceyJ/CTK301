            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Pacey J. Evans and I am a Junior at Illinois State University. I like listening to music, playing games, making games, traveling, and hanging out with my friends. I currently work at the Watterson Dining Hall as a Student Manager and I really enjoy my time there! I am also a Creative Technologies major and plan on becoming a Game Designer when I graduate college.</p>

            <p>The audio above this line of text is one of the many songs that I would listen to while I'm working on something. Whether it's working on a game I gotta finish or other homework. It's pretty relaxing and it's a Hip-Hop remix of a song that I already like. Another thing is that I used to also make music before I came to college. It was pretty fun at times and I would sometimes go back and play my guitar for a bit, just so I could have some nostaglia. When I came into college though, I learned that making games kinda made me feel the same thing. It helped me clear my head of the problems that I already had to deal with and helped me enter another world without such problems in my head. It also reminded me of some shows that I would watch from time to time. Speaking of shows, I like to watch some anime as well. One of my favorite is Blood Blockade Battlefront. It's the gif thats right next to the text!</p>
